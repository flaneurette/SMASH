# SMASH Test Suite.

To run tests to see how smash performs and transpiles, simly run: `test-suite.smash` directly in your terminal after installing.

Alternative:

```
sudo smash /examples/test-suite/test-suite.smash
```

It should run error free. If not, please open an issue to describe your finding.
